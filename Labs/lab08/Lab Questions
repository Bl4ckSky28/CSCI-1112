Question 3:

Question 7: 

Sorted linked list:
Insert: O(n) 
Search: O(n)

Unsorted linked list:
Insert: O(1)
Search: O(n)

Time complexity for searching is the same whether the list is sorted or unsorted, while the time complexity for insert is more efficient if the list is not sorted.

Question 9:

Sorted:
Insert: O(1)
Search: O(logn)

Unsorted:
Insert: O(1)
Search: O(n)

Question 13:
n! is worse than a^n, for any a.

If a = 2 and n = 5:
2^5 = 32
5! = 120

Even for a relatively small number such as 5, factorial growth quickly outpaces exponential growth. Factorial will outpace exponential at a larger n if a is larger.
